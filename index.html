              Academic success can be the framework to a young individuals whole future. Dreams of being an astronaut, doctor, or trades worker can inspire someone to work to the best of their abilities in order to achieve that goal. While school systems are very structured and provide strict educational programming, there are many factors that go into each students’ accomplishments. In this analysis, we will be using multiple sources to determine whether there are any significant relationships between a student choosing to seek higher education and high school district demographics, financial characteristics, and extra-curricular funding, specifically in Wisconsin.
              <br>
              <br>
              Attending school isn’t strictly about academics and acing every test. School is a time when children form habits, create relationships, set goals, and develop new passions. Providing the opportunities for each student is essential and can determine the future path they take. There are many impacting factors that go into budgetary needs. Our analysis will determine the amount of funding provided per student in academic departments verses extra activity departments in determining the child’s chances of pursuing secondary education.
              <br>
              <br>
              School Districts have a lot to take into account when it comes to finding a balance in funding academics, assisted programs, extra-curricular activities, and other budgetary needs. The National Center for Education Statistics states “Extracurricular activities provide a channel for reinforcing the lessons learned in the classroom, offering students the opportunity to apply academic skills in a real-world context, and are thus considered part of a well-rounded education.” Through much of their research, they were able to provide statistical backing based on data collected from US public schools. Other organizations, such as the National Federation of State High School Associations, have done research on the importance of funding these activities even though they only make up a small portion of the overall budgetary funding provided per student. The benefits of budget allocation to these programs not only boost the academic success of its students, but improve community standards and create well rounded individuals that will continue on to have positive impacts on society.
              <br>
              <br>
              When parents are considering schools, they not only take into account the success of academic ratings, but the additional activities and organizations it has to offer. With careful budget analysis, school can set themselves up for the most success and an opportunity for growth by attracting more students, creating a positive reputation, and providing resources for each student to thrive.

                    <h6>The Department of Public Instruction is the state agency that advances public education and libraries in Wisconsin. Their mission is to ensure that every child, regardless of zip code, has access to quality public education programs, enrichment opportunities, and special education supports, so that all of the children in Wisconsin can be successful. Through the WDPI site, we were able to explore available data pertaining to school performance, budgetary allocation, economic demographics, enrollment in post-secondary education, as well as other public records. 
                        With this information we could explore a possible correlation between funding towards extracurricular activities and a students odds of continuing their education. In this analysis, we only took into account information provided for the 2017-2018 school year.

            <br>
            <h2>Data Exploration and Initial Analysis</h2>
            <p> Initial data examination and identification began with making choices on what and how to scrape from the DPI site. Publicly available data goes back more than twenty years, so it was necessary for the team to first narrow down the scope. While a recent two- to three-year scope was identified by the team as desirable to examine trends, the global pandemic had a significant effect on school district reporting and trends, so a decision was made to collect data from the 2017-18, 2018-19, 2019-20, 2020-21, and 2021-22 school years. In this way, the team hoped to focus on multiple year trends and the most recent data, while still allowing for anomalous data from the years affected most by the pandemic.
  
              Examination began by pulling all available data for each year, joining the tables to create tables that reflected the longitudinal data for each report in preparation for more detailed examination, database creation, and table joins and querying.</p>

                        <p> A very basic analysis of overall funding and its impact on achievement scores can be completed as seen below; however, there are many factors that need to be taken into account to determine a monetary value that ensures the success of each student.  To further explore adequet funding that yeilds high achievement scores/continuing education, we will narrow our search to impactful information and make sure data is evenly weighed per student. </p>

                        <p>While pulling data, the team immediately identified two confounding factors: post-secondary data has not yet been reported and uploaded to DPI for the 2021-22 school year, and school district report card data is not available for the 2019-20 school year.</p>

                        <h3>Data Point Inconsistency</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Individual fields within the collected data that purported to show the same data still contained inconsistencies. For example, one report may refer to district 14 as "Adams-Friendship Area" and another as "Adams Friendship Area Schools". Most reports also contained student enrollment data, but the data varied slightly due to the points in time when it was collected. Districts report enrollment on the third Friday of September, but post-secondary enrollment reporting is based on much more dyniamic sources of information.
  
                          Other important outlier data included district types. Typical extracurricular spending increases at the secondary level. While most districts within the state are K-12 (meaning they serve students from kindergarten through twelfth grade), there are a number of other configurations. For example, the Big Foot Joint School District is a 9-12 only district, serving four separate K-8 districts as a consolidated high school. Although the students all flow up to the same secondary school district, each feeder district maintains it's own costs, revenues, and budgets.</p>

The State of Wisconsin makes all of this data available, but because the data includes every single coded expenditure for every district for the entire school year, each year is split into multiple files. When combining this data, the team needed to make multiple decisions in order to pare the data down. Initial attempts to join the tables led to creation of a database that was so large even Google CoLab was unable to parse it.</p>

            <p>Random forest is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm that is used widely in Classification and Regression problems. It uses bagging and feature randomness when building each individual tree to try to create an uncorrelated forest of trees whose prediction by committee is more accurate than that of any individual tree.

We had determined that spending in other areas of school administration were not needed for this analysis. The data was split using train_test_split to ensure a random sample.

                        <h3>Overall Conclusion</h3>

                        <p>Once data had been cleaned and filtered down into a set usable with the resources we had available (limiting post-secondary data to only full sets by school and limiting spending and achievement data to only the 2017-18 school year), we were not able to pinpoint a “sweet spot” of extracurricular spending per student. However use of the Random Forests model allowed the team to identify important factors. The three most important factors were total revenue, number of students, and the percentage of economically disadvantaged students. While "group count" showed in our model as an important factor, it is a direct subset of the number of students, so was excluded from our final analysis. After reviewing the results and correlations shown within the model, it was clear that larger, more affluent school districts (those with higher student counts and higher levels of revenue per student) are best poised to spend highly on extracurricular activites.
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          Several factors merit further analysis using resources not available to a student group. Revenue levels per student are particularly sticky in Wisconsin, given the implementation of revenue growth caps in 1993. Since then, school districts have been limited to increasing their revenues within specific areas to a specific percentage, unless they use a referendum. Arguments have been made that the growth cap has artificially frozen districts into spending models that are not reflective of their current makeup and structure (https://www.wpr.org/rising-referendums-school-funding-101). Further longitudinal dives into the specific revenue levels per student historically may shed light on whether districts that have seen dramatic changes in makeup since the 1993 freeze are able to adjust and provide the same levels of extracurricular spending allowed by districts that have remained unchanged.</p>

        </h2>
      </div>
      <div class="container banner-text">
        <p>Throughout this project, there will be various technologies used in order to form our analysis, and create a dashboard that will easily communicate the results to school district personnel, parents, or other curious individuals on the importance of funding allocations roll in student pursing higher education. Python will be our main programming language to conduct our analysis. Jupyter Notebook, SQL Postgres, and Google Colab will be the interactive web tool we will use to create computational output and visualizations. Machine learning concepts will be used to predict the impact of all variables within the data, with a focus on budgetary allotment to extracurricular activities, and the chances of a student continuing their education following high school. Once we have collected all of our data, altered the content to our needs, and created visual representations, we will use Flask to create a dashboard that clearly displays our findings. Amazon web service (AWS) may be used in cloud computing solutions, database storage, and content delivery.
